          At Northern Heights Dental, people come first. We help each of our
          patients <br />
          to achieve optimal wellness and health by using a whole body approach
          to oral <br />
          health. This means not just focusing on cavities, but focusing on;
          cranio-facial <br />
          development, bite and joint balance, oral flora, proper muscle
          balance/ <br />
          function, and bio-compatibility of dental materials. Great care and
          planning <br />
          ensure that everything we do helps promote overall health and well
          being.

          More than anything else we love creating happy, healthy <br />
          smiles.

          We work hard to stay up to date with the most advanced techniques and
          <br />
          technologies to ensure that our patients receive the best care
          possible. Our <br />
          office utilizes 3D CBCT radiographs to allow for guided surgical and
          <br />
          endodontic protocols. This enables these procedures to performed
          digitally <br />
          before they are performed surgically to ensure optimal results. 3D
          imaging <br />
          also is utilized for the analysis of airway growth and development. We
          also use <br />
          the best 3D optical scanner for all of our dental restoration and
          Invisalign <br />
          impressions. Dr Williams is a strong advocate for using microsurgical
          <br />
          techniques, this means less discomfort and faster healing times.
